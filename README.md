# CoffeAppSimulation

**Customer registration application simulation for coffee companies in accordance with object-oriented programming principles.**

## Scenario;

=> We want to write a customer management system for coffee shops. We work for Starbucks and Nero. Both companies want to register their customers in their own databases. When Starbucks records customers, it definitely wants to verify whether the customer is genuine. Nero does not require any verification process for customer records.
